# cadmium-contamination-prediction

In this work we try to predict cadmium-contamination level using different machine learning algorithms:

1- Report.docx: This report includes a summary of  data collection, EDA, feature selection, and modeling results.

2- EDA_new_version.ipynb : this notebook has the EDA  implementation code 

3- Feature_selection.ipynb: This notebook has feature selection methods, and modeling  implementation code
